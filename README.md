Stick
======

Overview
--------

*Stick* is a self contained collection of data structures, containers, clocks, threading primitives, error and file utilities.
It is designed as an alternative to the C++ standard library. While the C++ standard library is great in a lot of ways, *Stick* is built from scratch in order to simplify custom memory allocation, which can be quite a nightmare with the C++ standard library. Additionally, *Stick* does not use Exceptions and prefers error codes, asserts, optionals and ensure mechanisms similar to *Rust's* `unwrap` (called `assert` in newer *Rust* versions) to handle errors.

Supported Platforms
